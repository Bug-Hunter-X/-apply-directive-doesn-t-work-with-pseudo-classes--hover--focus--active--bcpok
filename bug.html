This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-class selector, such as `hover`, `focus`, or `active`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles of these pseudo-class selectors to the target element. For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

This will not change the background color of the button on hover.
